I am currently using Python 3.8.8, if for any reason the version of python you are using does not work, please install 3.8.8.

Please first install pip and ENSURE that you ADD PYTHON TO ENVIROMENT VARIABLES (This option can be found at the start of a Python installation).

Then go to your terminal and type in "pip install <dependancy>"
(If "pip install <dependancy>" does not work, then please try "py -m pip install <dependancy>")

After all dependancies has been installed, you may run the program.

I have added links to the bottom of this file for further guidance on how to install all the dependancies if required.

***ENSURE THAT THE LIGHTING IS GOOD AS IT MAY CAUSE THE SCANNER TO NOT WORK AS INTENDED***

Scan all the faces without messing up the orientation by clicking F, R, B, L, U, D on your keyboard.

Once all faces has been scanned correctly, you may click "Enter" to show the solution.

***PLEASE NOTE***

If faces are not scanned properly, you will need to check for the incorrect face(s) and re-scan it.
